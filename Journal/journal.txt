Week 1

I used AI to grammar check each of my writing assignments, which are mostly discussion responses. I do not have the AI link because I used Grammarly instead of ChatGPT.

I also utilized AI to better understand this week's lecture notes. I was initially confused about what the number 35 did in {soil:35} because I didn't see that number in the printed statement. I also asked ChatGPT to explain .format as the note encouraged asking AI about it. Here is my AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c30681-a530-800f-9e76-dc40c3ecca7a. As seen through the link, I used ChatGPT to develop a deeper understanding of the notes by going through each line in the lines of code I needed clarity on; however, I did not use ChatGPT to complete coding exercises or write any code for me to use at all.

Week 2

I searched up the pop() function since I never learned about that function in INST126. Although I didn't intend on using AI, the first result was an AI overview, so I read that in order to understand the pop() function. I chose to read the AI answer not only because it was at the top, but because it looked the shortest and I felt that I didn't need an in-depth explanation for the function. I ended up briefly looking at the AI overview for a couple of seconds and immediately understood the function without having to scroll further down on the overview. Here is the link to view the AI overview: https://www.google.com/search?q=pop+function+python&oq=pop+functio&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgAEEUYOxiABDIJCAAQRRg7GIAEMgcIARAAGIAEMgYIAhBFGEAyBggDEEUYOTIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABNIBCDIyNjZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8. 

I used ChatGPT to explain the last question of this week's exercise as I didn't feel as though I understood the question completely. ChatGPT broke down the prompt into steps, which was very helpful as it made me realize that I was overcomplicating the question.

Week 3

I used ChatGPT in this week's exercise. I couldn't get to the bottom of why my program kept outputting -1. I looked over my program multiple times, ensuring that my spelling and overall code structure was correct. After becoming frustrated, I decided to put my code into ChatGPT and ask why I kept getting -1 as the result. Here is my AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68d9c576a1b881919e3a93b193203c60. I immediately realized that I made a careless mistake of putting my else statement inside my loop, which prevented the program from checking the rest of the list. I made this mistake twice, as I left the else statement inside another loop, preventing my function from checking the rest of the list.
