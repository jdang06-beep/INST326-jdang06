Week 1

I used AI to grammar check each of my writing assignments, which are mostly discussion responses. I do not have the AI link because I used Grammarly instead of ChatGPT.

I also utilized AI to better understand this week's lecture notes. I was initially confused about what the number 35 did in {soil:35} because I didn't see that number in the printed statement. I also asked ChatGPT to explain .format as the note encouraged asking AI about it. Here is my AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c30681-a530-800f-9e76-dc40c3ecca7a. As seen through the link, I used ChatGPT to develop a deeper understanding of the notes by going through each line in the lines of code I needed clarity on; however, I did not use ChatGPT to complete coding exercises or write any code for me to use at all.

Week 2

I searched up the pop() function since I never learned about that function in INST126. Although I didn't intend on using AI, the first result was an AI generated response, so I read that in order to understand the pop() function. I chose to read the AI answer not only because it was at the top, but because it looked the shortest and I felt that I didn't need an in-depth explanation for the function. I ended up briefly looking at the AI overview for a couple of seconds and immediately understood the function without having to scroll further down on the overview.

I used ChatGPT to explain the last question of this week's exercise as I didn't feel as though I understood the question completely. ChatGPT broke down the prompt into steps, which was very helpful as it made me realize that I was overcomplicating the question. Here is my AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68d02be06a30819184cb82ef8dc47d72

Week 3

I used ChatGPT in this week's exercise. I couldn't get to the bottom of why my program kept outputting -1. I looked over my program multiple times, ensuring that my spelling and overall code structure was correct. After becoming frustrated, I decided to put my code into ChatGPT and ask why I kept getting -1 as the result. Here is my AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68d9c576a1b881919e3a93b193203c60. I immediately realized that I made a careless mistake of putting my else statement inside my loop, which prevented the program from checking the rest of the list. I made this mistake twice, as I left the else statement inside another loop, preventing my function from checking the rest of the list. Here is the AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68d9c7ad4754819187a5a50bc51322ec.

Week 4

I searched up the meaning of "pad to 6 digits," as I saw it written in one of the exercise prompts. I used the AI overview to find the answer to my question. I immediately found out that padding to 6 digits means adding 0 to a number until there are 6 digits, as seen with the link: https://www.google.com/search?q=pad+to+6+digits+meaning&oq=pad+to+6+digits+meaning&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgAEEUYOxifBTIJCAAQRRg7GJ8FMgcIARAhGKABMgcIAhAhGKABMgcIAxAhGKABMgcIBBAhGKABMgcIBRAhGJ8FMgcIBhAhGJ8FMgcIBxAhGJ8FMgcICBAhGJ8F0gEIMzE5MmowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8.

I saw "m.borrow_one(); m.borrow_one(); m.borrow_one()" in a single line of code for one of this week's exercises. I thought that that code just repeated the method multiple times, but I wanted to confirm so I asked ChatGPT what this line of code does. It confirmed my guess, as seen in the AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68e335b5a944819193ef43b718bef407.

Week 5

I searched up how to get an ISO date string on Google. I used the AI overview box because it was on top of the results and I wanted to find an answer quickly without having to click on a site. The AI overview provided two best methods to get an ISO date string and I used the first method, which was .isoformat(), as seen with the link: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+do+i+as+ISO+date+strings+%27YYYY-MM-DD%27+in+python&oq=how+do+i+as+ISO+date+strings+%27YYYY-MM-DD%27+in+python&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgkIBRAhGAoYoAEyBwgGECEYqwIyBwgHECEYqwLSAQg0MTc4ajBqOagCBrACAfEF94Ry1W_2Pvs&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8.

I also searched up how to collapse internal whitespace to single spaces on Google. I used the AI overview box again because I didn't feel like scrolling to look for an answer. I used the first method that the AI overview provided, which was using str.split() and str.join(), as seen with the link: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+collapse+internal+whitespace+to+single+spaces+in+python&oq=how+to+collapse+internal+whitespace+to+single+spaces+in+python&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQxNDRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8.

Week 6

I used ChatGPT to clarify the purpose of a single underscore in the beginning of a class attribute. I had only remembered the meaning of two underscores in the beginning of a class attribute, so reading Chat's response gave me more clarity on the difference between a class attribute with no underscores and a class attribute with one underscore. In the end, the response allowed me to understand why the class attribute in the third exercise was _counter, not __counter or counter. Here is my AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68ffcf9f5db481918b4576698d178668.

I also used ChatGPT if it was necessary to include type hints like :str and :int because I saw that my groupmate didn't include the type hints in their class. Up until I asked ChatGPT, I thought the hints were required for classes. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68ffd0aee6b08191ae8651945aec6a2e.

Week 7

I didn't know what purpose "(Exception)" served in the Starter Helpers for this week's exercises. I searched up what it does online; however, I didn't find an answer immediately. In fact, Google gave me answers that addressed "exception" in the body, not next to class. As a result, I moved to ChatGPT to directly ask, "what does (exception) in class LibraryError(Exception): do?" Here is the AI chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_690d1b69016481918bea101feee624d5.

By first glance, I didn't fully understand what the line of code "self.add_book(Book(isbn=item['isbn'], title=item['title'], copies=item.get('copies', 1)))" was doing in the Starter Helpers, so I went to ChatGPT. I thought the code was adding to a dictionary, so I was confused why there were more than two arguments. I didn't understand how that worked since just a key and its value are usually added to dictionary. I asked ChatGPT to explain, and it made it clear that the line of code wasn't adding to a dictionary but creaing a Book object.

Week 8

I didn't know what a naive stock check was in this week's starter code, so I went to Google to search up what it is in Python. I used the AI overview to find the answer, which made me realize that a naive stock check wasn't as technical as I thought or directly related to anything in terms of code. Here is the AI overview: https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+naive+stock+check+in+python&oq=what+is+naive+stock+check+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgFECEYoAEyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigATIHCAUQIRigATIHCAYQIRiPAjIHCAcQIRiPAtIBCDgyODhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8.

Since I started this week's exercises late, I needed a reminder on method inheritance, so I asked ChatGPT to clarify the differences between method overriding and method inheritance. Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_691920b145fc819184cf9242c816d73a. Reading the answers helped me feel more confident in my polymorphic design.

Week 9

I needed help with adding borrowable on the sixth exercise, so I asked ChatGPT to provide an example of an abstract property for borrowable items. The example showed me exactly how to define the abstract property and how to override it in PrintedBook, EBook, and AudioBook, as seen with the link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_6925020a78388191bb5bc2d7ba0b3e57.

I also needed help with exercise 15 to create a unittest suite, so I asked ChatGPT, "How can I write unittest tests to confirm that subclasses implement abstract methods correctly?" Here is the chat link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_6925031015388191b24fbfcd9cb871c7.

Week 10

I wasn't certain on how to approach exercise 8, specifically creating a new Book while leaving the original unchanged. This led me to ask ChatGPT, "How can I create a modified copy of a dataclass instance without changing the original?" ChatGPT provided an example code which I used to outline my code for exercise 8. The example code can be seen with the link: https://chatgpt.com/s/t_692b436926448191926c10ee432ba400. I also referred back to this conversation as I worked on exercise 12 since I had to write a method that returned a new Book with more copies, without changing the original.
